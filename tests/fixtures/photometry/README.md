Photometry fixtures (IES)

Provenance and usage
- This folder contains small, synthetic IES files intended only for testing Luxera's parsing and analysis.
- These files are not derived from vendor photometry or copyrighted packs.
- Keep fixtures minimal and deterministic to support regression tests.

If you add a new fixture
- Prefer synthetic IES created specifically for tests.
- Document its intent and expected properties in the test that uses it.
