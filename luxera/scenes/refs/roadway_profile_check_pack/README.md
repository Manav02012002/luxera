# Roadway Profile Check Pack

Intent: verify scene-level `roadway.profile` selection against data-driven standards tables and export of compliance checks.

This pack uses `profile = demo_nonstandard_placeholder` and validates profile id/name plus deterministic compliance table fields through parity expected metrics.
